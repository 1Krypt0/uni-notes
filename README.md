# Uni Notes

A collection of Notes I have taken to study for university. Made possible by the awesome features of [Logseq](https://logseq.com/)

## Where to start

The [landing pages gives](https://1krypt0.github.io/uni-notes/#/page/university) an overview of what can be expected for the page, and has some useful links for everything else.

**A small disclaimer:** Do note that these are my notes, and they are written with my study needs in mind. They are not a one size fits all solution, and probably never will be, but they may be useful to get another point of view on the subjects
